FTP
Experiment : 4
Aim : To create and configure FTP Server
Description :
FTP Server
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a TCP protocol for downloading files between
computers. In the past, it has also been used for uploading but, as that method does
not use encryption, user credentials as well as data transferred in the clear and are
easily intercepted. So if you are here looking for a way to upload and download files
securely,
FTP works on a client/server model. The server component is called an FTP daemon.
It continuously listens for FTP requests from remote clients. When a request is
received, it manages the login and sets up the connection. For the duration of the
session it executes any of commands sent by the FTP client
Port No: 21
Package name: vsftpd
Configuration file: /etc/vsftpd.conf
Procedure:
1. Install the vsftpd - FTP Server Installation in the ubuntu operating system
$sudo apt install vsftpd
2. By default vsftpd is not configured to allow anonymous download. If you wish to
enable anonymous download edit /etc/vsftpd.conf by changing:
$anonymous_enable=YES
3. During installation a ftp user is created with a home directory of /srv/ftp. This is
the default FTP directory.
If you wish to change this location, to /srv/files/ftp for example, simply create a
directory in another location and change the ftp userâ€™s home directory:
$sudo mkdir -p /srv/files/ftp
$sudo usermod -d /srv/files/ftp ftp
4. After making the change restart vsftpd:
$ sudo service vsftpd restart
5. User Authenticated FTP Configuration
By default vsftpd is configured to authenticate system users and allow them to
download files. If you want users to be able to upload files, edit /etc/vsftpd.conf
 $write_enable=YES
6. Now restart vsftpd:
 $ sudo service vsftpd restart

7. Securing FTP
There are options in /etc/vsftpd.conf to help make vsftpd more secure.
$chroot_local_user=YES
$chroot_list_enable=YES
$chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list
8. After uncommenting the above options, create a /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list
 containing a list of users one per line.

9. Then restart vsftpd:
 $sudo service vsftpd restart

10. To configure FTPS, edit /etc/vsftpd.conf and at the bottom add:
 $ssl_enable=YES

11. Then check the vsftpd status
 $sudo service vsftpd status
12. Now connect to ftp by the command
 $ftp -p 192.168.234.128

13. Now install filezilla in ubuntu and open the filezilla and specify the ip address
and port number of the ftp server then click connect
