SSH
Experiment: 6
Aim: Installation of Open SSH between two ubuntu machines.
Description:
Remote File Sharing using SSH
OpenSSH is a powerful collection of tools for the remote control of, and transfer of
data between, networked computers. You will also learn about some of the
configuration settings possible with the OpenSSH server application and how to
change them on your Ubuntu system.
OpenSSH is a freely available version of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol family of
tools for remotely controlling, or transferring files between computers. Traditional
tools used to accomplish these functions, such as telnet or rcp, are insecure and
transmit the userâ€™s password in cleartext when used. OpenSSH provides a server
daemon and client tools to facilitate secure, encrypted remote control and file
transfer operations, effectively replacing the legacy tools.
Port No: 22

$ssh_keygen
8. Now copy the ssh_keygen form the ssh_client $ssh-copy-id
ubuntu@privateip
